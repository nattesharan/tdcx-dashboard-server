# Getting Started with the App

You can view the deployed backend at [https://tdcx-dashboard-server.herokuapp.com](https://tdcx-dashboard-server.herokuapp.com) .

Make sure node js and npm are installed.

After cloning the repo navigate to the root directory of the project and run the below command to install all the packages which are needed for the app to run. 

### `npm install`

## Database

The database used for the backend is Mongodb and its hosted on [https://cloud.mongodb.com/](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) . So there's no need to have mongodb configured in the system.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `nodemon`
(or)
### `node index.js`

This runs the backend on [http://localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001).\
Open [http://localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001) to check if its up and running.
